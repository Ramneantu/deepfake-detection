# Frequency Solver
In this project we are doing DeepFake detection using the frequency spectrum as input. 
This project is inspired and based on the work of Durall *et al.*  in [Unmasking Deepfakes with simple Features](https://github.com/cc-hpc-itwm/DeepFakeDetection). 

The goal of this framework is to offer an easy and accessible platform for performing experiments in different settings.

- project has been tested on Pop!_OS based on Ubuntu 20.04 
- I used a conda environment and PyCharm professional to run the notebook
- and python 3.8

Following libraries are needed to create the conda environment:
- numpy
- opencv-python
- scikit learn
- notebook (for running the jupyter notebook)
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- absl-py
